@techreport{snyder:1987,
  abstract = {After decades of using only one map projection, the Polyconic, for
	its mapping program, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) now uses several
	of the more common projections for its published maps. For larger
	scale maps, including topographic quadrangles and the State Base
	Map Series, conformal projections such as the Transverse Mercator
	and the Lambert Conformal Conic are used. Equal-area and equidistant
	projections appear in the National Atlas. Other projections, such
	as the Miller Cylindrical and the Van der Grinten, are chosen occasionally
	for convenience, sometimes making use of existing base maps prepared
	by others. Some projections treat the Earth only as a sphere, others
	as either ellipsoid or sphere. The USGS has also conceived and designed
	several new projections, including the Space Oblique Mercator, the
	first map projection designed to permit mapping of the Earth continuously
	from a satellite with low distortion. The mapping of extraterrestrial
	bodies has resulted in the use of standard projections in completely
	new settings. Several other projections which have not been used
	by the USGS are frequently of interest to the cartographic public.
	With increased computerization, it is important to realize that rectangular
	coordinates for all these projections may be mathematically calculated
	with formulas which would have seemed too complicated in the past,
	but which now may be programmed routinely, especially if aided by
	numerical examples. A discussion of appearance, usage, and history
	is given together with both forward and inverse equations for each
	projection involved.},

abstract = {"Covering point process theory, random geometric graphs and coverage processes, this rigorous introduction to stochastic geometry will enable you to obtain powerful, general estimates and bounds of wireless network performance and make good design choices for future wireless architectures and protocols that efficiently manage interference effects. Practical engineering applications are integrated with mathematical theory, with an understanding of probability the only prerequisite. At the same time, stochastic geometry is connected to percolation theory and the theory of random geometric graphs and accompanied by a brief introduction to the R statistical computing language. Combining theory and hands-on analytical techniques with practical examples and exercises, this is a comprehensive guide to the spatial stochastic models essential for modelling and analysis of wireless network performance"--},

abstract = {Achieve faster and more efficient network design and optimization with this comprehensive guide. Some of the most prominent researchers in the field explain the very latest analytic techniques and results from stochastic geometry for modelling the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distribution in heterogeneous cellular networks. This book will help readers to understand the effects of combining different system deployment parameters on key performance indicators such as coverage and capacity, enabling the efficient allocation of simulation resources. In addition to covering results for network models based on the Poisson point process, this book presents recent results for when non-Poisson base station configurations appear Poisson, due to random propagation effects such as fading and shadowing, as well as non-Poisson models for base station configurations, with a focus on determinantal point processes and tractable approximation methods. Theoretical results are illustrated with practical Long-Term Evolution (LTE) applications and compared with real-world deployment results.},

abstract = {Heavy-tailed probability distributions are an important component in the modeling of many stochastic systems. They are frequently used to accurately model inputs and outputs of computer and data networks and service facilities such as call centers. They are an essential for describing risk processes in finance and also for insurance premia pricing, and such distributions occur naturally in models of epidemiological spread. The class includes distributions with power law tails such as the Pareto, as well as the lognormal and certain Weibull distributions.One of the highlights of this new edition is that it includes problems at the end of each chapter. Chapter 5 is also updated to include interesting applications to queueing theory, risk, and branching processes. New results are presented in a simple, coherent and systematic way.Graduate students as well as modelers in the fields of finance, insurance, network science and environmental studies will find this book to be an essential reference.},
